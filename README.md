# Source Code for Server Version API
This repository stores the API Definition, Lambda source code, and DynamoDB table structure. 

API Gateway is in Swagger format.
Lambda is in NodeJS.
DynamoDB has a primarykey of versionid as a String. It's schemaless, so we can put anything in there.

Changes welcome - please submit PR if you have improvements - or cut an issue.
